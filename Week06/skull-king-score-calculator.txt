Alright... Let's think this through...



This should be simple, yet hard because of the fancy rules of scoring:

Scoring rules: 
If you get the amount of tricks you guessed you would get that round, 
you would get that many points * 10 (say I bet I'd get 4 tricks and I got 4 tricks after the round ended I'd have 40 points)
However if I miss my mark then I will subtract points based on how off I was (say I bet 4 and got 3 then I'd get -10 points)

Zero is a special case:
This all depends on the round. If you bet you'll win zero wins then you will get 10 points depending on the round number
(so if it was round 5 and i bet 0 and got 0 tricks then I'd get 50 points)
Here's the catch, you lose that many points if you even get a single tricks
(If I got 1 trick when I bet 0 on round 9 then I'd get -90 points)

I first need to write that rule system into a function to have as a function.

I'll have another function that will read what the user inputs into the calculator and pass it through the previous function.

Have a listener to listen for a click on the calculate.
